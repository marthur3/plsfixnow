## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Which AI tools work with this?
Any AI that accepts images. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf—if it has vision capabilities, it works. Just export your annotated screenshot and paste it into your AI chat.

### How is this different from just taking a regular screenshot?
Regular screenshots require you to type out "see that button on the left, below the header, next to the icon..." With numbered annotations, you just say "fix the issue at #1" or "change #2 to blue." Your AI sees exactly what you mean.

### Do I need the Pro version to use this with AI?
Nope. The free version gives you 5 annotated screenshots per day, which is plenty for most developers. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited screenshots and watermark-free exports.

### Does this work on any website?
Yes. Capture screenshots from any website you're viewing. Perfect for debugging your own apps, reporting issues, or getting design feedback from your AI.

### Are my screenshots stored securely?
All screenshots and annotations are stored locally in your Chrome browser. Nothing is uploaded to external servers, ensuring your privacy and security.
